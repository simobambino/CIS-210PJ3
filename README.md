# CIS-210PJ3
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
# This project was designed to call back to a set of data on a group of items, print the stored data as output, and save the item frequencies to a data file.

# What did you do particularly well?
# I enjoyed doing the menu layout, making it neat and having it look nice after I finish coding it.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
# With my current experience, I am not too sure. Maybe later down the line I will come back and see what experience has shown me.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
# Trying to get the program to actually read the data file and making sure the data file was actually in the right location for the program to read it. I had to do constant tests over and over to finally get it to     # recognize it.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
# I really do think being able to call a data file and use its data in a program is going to be constantly used in just about any program.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
# Practicing industry standards, in-line comments, and proper spacing
